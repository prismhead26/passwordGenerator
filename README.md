# Password Generator

## Description

The main goal of this project is to create create an application that enables employees to generate random passwords based on criteria that theyâ€™ve selected. This app will run in the browser and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code. It will also have a clean and polished, responsive user interface that adapts to multiple screen sizes.
<br>
After completion of the project, I have a better understanding on declaring/calling variables, functions, if-statemtns, ternary operators and for loops. I also learned some better ways to write the JavaScript, thus making the code easier to read and more modular!

CSS, CSS Selectors, Media queries, resets, etc.
<br>
Basic HTML template with semantic elements.

## Tests

In order to test, run the program using the "Open with Live Server" Exstension.
<br>
I would also have DevTools open to see the logs.
<br>
Note: If the criteria and/or password is not generating properly, simply refresh the page.
<br>
There are also a few test logs in the console to help ensure the app is fully operable.
