# passwordGenerator

## Description

The main goal of this project is to create a codebase that follows accessibility standards, so that the site is optimized for search engines. And it makes certain that people with disabilities can access the website.
<br>
After completion of the project, I have a better understanding of the git "flow" process as well as using pseudocode to break down and manage the project into managable segments. I also learned some better ways to write the CSS, thus making the code easier to read and more modular!
